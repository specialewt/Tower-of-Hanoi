Our project is a mathematical puzzle game called Tower of Hanoi.  This game involves three identical rods placed at the left, center, and right of the screen and a specified number of disks which are all of different sizes.  In our version of the game, the number of disks must be between 3 and 7, inclusive.  Initially, all of the disks are placed on the leftmost rod and arranged in descending order such that the smallest disk is on the top of the rod’s stack and the largest disk is on the bottom of this stack.  The objective of this game is to move the disks one at a time so that they eventually end up arranged in descending order on the rightmost rod.  Only one disk can be moved at a time, and the disk being moved must be the topmost disk on one of the three rods.  Additionally, a larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk. 
 
For each number of disks, the fewest possible number of moves needed to end the game is given by the formula ,2 n −1 where  is the number of disks.  At the end of the game, the player’s number of moves is n compared to the fewest possible number of moves.
